# React Native Pokedex

This project is a React Native application that serves as a Pokedex, providing information about various Pokémon.

I use the [Pokebuild API](https://pokebuildapi.fr/api/v1)

## Features
* Progressive loading of Pokémon to avoid excessive network requests
* Search for a Pokémon by its name
* Filter Pokémon by type(s) or generation
* Display Pokémon details (generation, types, attacks, defenses, and evolutions)
* Ability to create a Pokédex using AsyncStorage: you can catch and release Pokémon
* Use of React Native-specific features. For example, the bottom drawer allows displaying additional information while staying on the same screen and using user gestures.

## Installation 
  git clone https://github.com/Jeremy-Cloarec/react-native-pokedex.git
  
  cd react-native-pokedex
  
  npm install
  
  npx expo start
