# React Native Pokedex

(Project in progress)

This project is a React Native application that serves as a Pokedex, providing information about various Pokémon.

I use the [Pokebuild API](https://pokebuildapi.fr/api/v1)

## Features
* **Pokémon Listing**: Browse a list of Pokémon with their basic information.
* **Detailed View**: Click on a Pokémon to view detailed information including stats, abilities.
* **Build your own Pokedex**
* **Search and Filter Functionalities**: Search for your favorite Pokemon by name.
* **Geolocalisation**: Display Pokémon around you and catch them

## Installation 
  git clone https://github.com/Jeremy-Cloarec/react-native-pokedex.git

  npm install
  
  npx expo start
